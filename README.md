# VSZipper App
This application zips up Visual Studio Projects and Solutions without unnecessary files/folders like the bin and obj directories.

## Installation Instructions
There isn't a way to install it yet.

## Roadmap
These are the things I want to accomplish.
 * Zip up a directory and all sub-directories
 * Exclude hidden folders and files
 * Exclude files and folders I specify (bin/obj/etc.)
 * Add to right-click menu in Windows
 * Allow for rename of zip file during creation
